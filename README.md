# Apollo Veritas
Named for the God Apollo, educator of children, and Goddess Veritas, symbol of truth.

### What is Apollo Veritas?
Apollo Veritas is a system to determine a source of truth for identity and account management within K12 environments.
Once a source of truth is determined, it can synchronize data between
identity management solutions, and applications that consume identities.

The most common, basic use case for Apollo Veritas is to take information from a Student Information System
create accounts in Active Directory, and synchronize that information to Google Workspace.
Any changes that are made in your SIS are then routinely and automatically synchronized to various IAM solutions.

### What problems does Apollo Veritas aim to solve?
First and foremost, Apollo Veritas automates student account creation, eliminating the need for someone to manually create accounts.
Once a student has been enrolled in your Student Information System, they can log in to district technology resources.

Secondly, it prevents configuration drift. It is quite common for an account to be initially provisioned automatically, 
but for changes in accounts to fall out of sync across various district resources.
Apollo Veritas ensures that all information in connected systems stays up to date.
